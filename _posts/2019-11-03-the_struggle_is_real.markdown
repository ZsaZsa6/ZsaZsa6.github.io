This week has been strenuous. Not only in the bootcamp, but in the rest of my life. 

I know have a deadline to complete my first project. On November 13th, I wil be flying to Idaho to see my parents. My father has been diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease and Lewy-Body Dementia. His ability to communicate is decreasing rapidly and I want to spend some time with him while he is able to speak to me coherently.

So I need to complete my first project by that date. But first, I have to make it through the Music Library CLI.

This lab is a killer!! Yes, it's a compilation of the lessons that have came before but through the AAQ chat, I have definitely learned some things that weren't in any of the lessons. For instance:

  `  def initialize(name, artist = nil, genre = nil)
    @name = name
    self.artist= artist if artist
    self.genre= genre if genre
  end`
	
	I never knew you could put "if" in an intialize method. It was the easiest way to solve the problem but to me it was definitely unorthodox from my point of view.
	
	So I have yet to finish the Music Library CLI lab, as I had to take a break to write out this blog post. Hopefully, I will find some other unorthodox methods to finish this one up so I can continue on and finish my first project!
