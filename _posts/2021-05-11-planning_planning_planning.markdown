**A good plan brings a better result and a better process**

Cakes take a lot of planning. People who don't make and  decorate cakes, don't often realize how much planning actually goes into that beautiful end result!! You can try to just "wing it" but that often results in disaster!!

Before I ever start baking, I have to figure out how many cups of frosting and cake batter I need to make, and how much of each ingredient I need to have. I always make out a diagram of what sizes, shapes and colors of cake and frosting I need for each cake. I plan out the design of each cake and make sure I have the structural support I will need to pull off that design. I make sure I have the beautiful little final touches available, and make sure I have all the equipment I need for the actual baking and decorating. 
After getting everything designed, listed and calculated, it's time to go shopping!! Cake making starts with a plan, well before the oven is ever turned on!

### A good piece of software takes a lot of planning

I have tried "winging it" when making a cake and I have had several "caketastrophes"!!

When I began my first project, I had an idea of what I wanted it to look like, but because I didn't even KNOW really how to plan for it, I forced myself to JUST START CODING!! I have learned, over time, better planning equals a better process and a better project.
