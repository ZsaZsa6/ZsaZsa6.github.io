I had to take a little break from the bootcamp to go visit my parents in Idaho. My dad has Parkinson's Disease and Lewy-Body Dementia. His loss of communication and physical disability is progressing quickly and I wanted to see him and visit with him before he stopped recognizing people or was unable to communicate at all. 

As I was heading out on my trip, I started the Scraping lab. I didn't know that I really wouldn't have time nor the mental focus to work while I was at my parents' house so I thought I could at least finish the lab before I came home. Didn't happen!!

Scraping is one of those "trial-and-error" type things until you really get good at it. I am not a fan of those sort of activities, as I really like to KNOW what I am doing. 

I am back to work on this today and hope to finish up before I take a couple days off to celebrate my 30th wedding anniversary.

Being in the online, self-paced bootcamp is great when life happens, as it seems to do often!!
